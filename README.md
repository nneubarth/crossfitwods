# crossfitwods
analyzing my workouts from 2016-2017

This is a simple project I did to better understand my crossfit workouts and behaviors this past year.I scraped workout 
data from my gym's website and combined that with my attendance, which I tracked using an IFTTT recipe. My goals were to
look for any patterns in the crossfit workouts at my gym and see if there were any features that might be informative if
I wanted to build a model to predict my future attendance.
